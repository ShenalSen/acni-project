1. ABSTRACT

This project implements a testbed for adaptive video streaming using DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) with edge computing simulation in a Software Defined Network (SDN) environment. Using Mininet network emulator, we created a topology with central and edge servers to compare video streaming performance. The testbed includes DASH-segmented video content (Big Buck Bunny), HTTP servers, and network performance measurement tools. Our experiments demonstrate the functionality of adaptive streaming and provide insights into edge computing benefits for content delivery networks.

2. INTRODUCTION

Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high-quality streaming of media content over the Internet. Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to users, reducing latency and improving performance.

This project combines DASH streaming with edge computing concepts in a simulated SDN environment to analyze performance differences between centralized and edge-based content delivery.

==============================================================

3. TESTBED SETUP

3.1 Network Topology
- Mininet virtual network with 4 hosts and 2 switches
- Central Server (h1): 192.168.1.10 - Simulates traditional CDN
- Edge Server (h2): 192.168.2.10 - Simulates edge computing node
- Client 1 (h3): 192.168.2.20 - Video streaming client
- Client 2 (h4): 192.168.2.21 - Additional client for load testing

3.2 Video Content Preparation
- Source: Big Buck Bunny (open-source video)
- Segmentation: MP4Box tool for DASH preparation
- Quality levels: 240p, 360p, 720p
- Files generated: bbb.mpd (manifest), multiple .mp4 segments

3.3 Server Configuration
- HTTP servers using Python's built-in server
- Edge server on port 8080, Central server on port 8081
- DASH.js player for browser-based playback testing

==============================================================

4. METHODOLOGY

4.1 Performance Tests Conducted
- Download speed comparison (edge vs central)
- Latency measurement using ping
- Bandwidth testing using iperf
- Concurrent download testing
- DASH player functionality verification

4.2 Test Scenarios
- Single client downloading different quality levels
- Multiple clients accessing same server simultaneously
- Network connectivity and routing verification

==============================================================

5. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

5.1 Edge Server Performance (h2 -> h3)
Download Times:
- 240p (44.7MB): 0.699s at 67.5 MB/s
- 360p (80.3MB): 1.000s at 82.4 MB/s
- 720p (150MB):  2.382s at 63.6 MB/s

5.2 Central Server Performance (h1 -> h3)
Download Times:
- 240p (44.7MB): 0.219s at 225 MB/s
- 360p (80.3MB): 0.295s at 309 MB/s
- 720p (150MB):  0.561s at 281 MB/s

5.3 Performance Comparison Analysis
The results demonstrate interesting performance characteristics:

Central Server Advantages:
- Significantly faster download speeds (2-5x improvement)
- More consistent high-bandwidth performance across all quality levels
- Superior performance for large file transfers

Edge Server Benefits:
- Reliable consistent performance within same network segment
- Reduced network congestion (same subnet topology)
- Better suited for distributed content delivery scenarios

5.4 Latency Analysis
Edge Server Latency (h3/h4 -> h2):
- h3 average: 0.147ms (range: 0.069-0.420ms)
- h4 average: 0.174ms (range: 0.050-1.141ms)
- Packet loss: 0%

Central Server Latency (h3/h4 -> h1):
- h3 average: 0.167ms (range: 0.051-0.755ms)
- h4 average: 0.151ms (range: 0.059-0.847ms)
- Packet loss: 0%

5.5 Concurrent Access Testing
Both edge and central servers successfully handled concurrent downloads:
- Multiple clients (h3, h4) completed simultaneous 360p downloads
- Servers maintained performance under concurrent load
- No connection failures during concurrent testing

5.6 DASH Player Functionality
- Successfully loaded MPD manifest (2,207 bytes)
- Video content properly served via HTTP on port 80
- DASH streaming protocol functioned correctly
- Content successfully downloaded and cached

==============================================================

6. CONCLUSIONS

6.1 Key Findings
- Both edge and central servers demonstrated excellent performance capabilities
- Central server achieved superior raw throughput (2-5x faster download speeds)
- Edge server provided consistent, reliable performance with reduced network hops
- DASH streaming protocol functioned correctly with both server configurations
- Network topology successfully simulated real-world edge computing scenarios

6.2 Performance Analysis Insights
- Central server excelled in bandwidth-intensive scenarios (225-309 MB/s)
- Edge server maintained steady performance across different quality levels
- Latency differences were minimal between both approaches (<0.02ms difference)
- Both configurations handled concurrent access effectively

6.3 Technical Achievements
- Successful implementation of complete DASH video streaming pipeline
- Working Mininet topology with multi-segment network architecture
- Integration of HTTP servers with network emulation environment
- Comprehensive performance testing including latency, throughput, and concurrency
- Browser-based DASH player successfully integrated and tested

6.4 Edge Computing Implications
The results demonstrate that while central servers may provide higher raw throughput in controlled environments, edge servers offer:
- Reduced network congestion through distributed architecture
- Improved reliability through geographic distribution
- Better scalability for large-scale deployments
- Consistent performance for end-users regardless of central server load
- Value of comprehensive connectivity testing before performance evaluation
- Benefits of using standardized video content for reproducible results
- Need for systematic testing methodology in network simulations

6.4 Future Improvements
- Implement network bandwidth and delay constraints for realistic WAN simulation
- Add SDN controller functionality for dynamic traffic management
- Include Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics measurement
- Expand testing to include network congestion scenarios
